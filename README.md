# JavaFX Dictionary project (English-to-English-and-English-to-Urdu)
It was our semester project. We used hash tables to implement dictionary and JavaFX to make beautiful user interface.
To run this project, just follow following steps:
                                                  (i) Download "Dictionary.zip" file of this project.
                                                  (ii) Open the Java IDE of your own choice e.g Netbeans, InteliJ
                                                  (iii) Just make a new project with existing resources and then by selecting the browse                                                          option, just select the "Dictionary.zip" file. Then IDE would import it.
                                                  (iv) Another important thing is that you should also download and include an external                                                          library named as 'Jfoenics.jar' in order to run the project.
